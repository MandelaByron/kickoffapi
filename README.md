# Django DRF and React Tutorial: Footballers Backend

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive tutorial focused on building a backend using Django Rest Framework (DRF) to serve a React frontend. The tutorial guides you through creating a robust API backend that handles data related to active footballers. By following along, you will gain hands-on experience with several key aspects of modern web development, particularly the integration of Django with a PostgreSQL database and the implementation of a variety of API endpoints.

### Key Learning Points

1. **Setting Up the Project**:
   - Initialize a new Django project.
   - Set up Django Rest Framework for API development.
   - Configure PostgreSQL as the project's database.

2. **Data Management**:
   - Import a JSON file containing data of active footballers into the PostgreSQL database.
   - Create and manage models for storing footballer data.

3. **Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT-based authentication to secure the API endpoints.
   - Create registration and login endpoints to manage user authentication.

4. **API Endpoints**:
   - Develop CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing footballer data and Users.
   - Implement search functionality with filters for attributes such as age, market value, club, and name.

5. **Admin Customization**:
   - Customize the Django admin interface to enhance the management of the Player model.
   - Add search capabilities, list filters, and display customizations to the admin panel.

### Project Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Users can register and log in using JWT-based authentication.
- **Comprehensive CRUD Operations**: Full set of endpoints to manage footballer data.
- **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Endpoints to search and filter footballers by various criteria such as age, market value, club, and name.
- **Enhanced Admin Interface**: A tailored admin interface for better handling of footballer data, including custom search fields, filters, and display options.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional backend that can seamlessly interact with a React frontend, providing a robust foundation for any sports-related application or any other project requiring similar backend capabilities.
